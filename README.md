# Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain Application
![Krypt](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)



## Introduction
I’m building a Web3 DApp that allows users to send Ethereum through the blockchain using a React frontend. I integrate MetaMask to securely manage users’ wallets and connect to the Ethereum network. I’m also writing Solidity smart contracts to handle transaction logic and maintain a ledger on-chain. This project is helping me apply blockchain concepts practically while improving my React, Node.js, and ethers.js skills.
